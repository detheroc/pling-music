    Superampify is based on the awesome <a href="http://www.subsonic.org/">subsonic</a> android 
    client by Sindre Mehus. Feel free to thank him donating on his project. We do, however, not
    encourage his ad and donationware version of the project, and thus, superampify is just a 
    clean <a href="http://github.com/interstel/superampify-android">fork</a> meeting the needs 
    of Runners-ID.
